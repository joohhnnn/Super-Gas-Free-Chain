# Project Introduction for SuperHack 2024

## Overview

Welcome to our innovative project developed on a forked chain of Optimism, specifically designed for SuperHack 2024. Our initiative is aimed at revolutionizing the user experience by enabling gas-free transactions. We have pre-deposited gas fees on behalf of users, allowing them to enjoy seamless interactions on the blockchain without incurring transaction costs.

## Project Components

### OP Node

The operational node for our project is based on a fork of the [Ethereum Optimism repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/compare/develop...joohhnnn:optimism:superhack2024?expand=1). You can view and participate in the development by visiting our comparison and contributions here:

### OP-Geth

Our custom Geth, tailored for Optimism, supports the backend of our zero-gas transaction model. This customization is integral to our approach to providing a sustainable and cost-effective solution for users.
